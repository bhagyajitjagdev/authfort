export const quickStart = `from authfort_service import ServiceAuth

service = ServiceAuth(
    jwks_url="https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    issuer="authfort",
)

payload = await service.verify_token(token)
print(payload.sub)    # user ID
print(payload.roles)  # ["admin", "editor"]`;

`authfort-service` is a lightweight JWT verifier for microservices. It validates tokens issued by an AuthFort server without needing database access.

## When to Use It

Use `authfort-service` when you have a **separate service** that needs to verify users but doesn't manage authentication itself. For example:

- An orders service that needs to know who the user is
- An analytics API that requires admin access
- A notifications service that processes user-specific data

These services don't need to know about passwords, sessions, or OAuth — they just need to verify that a request comes from an authenticated user.

## How It Works

1. Your auth server (running `authfort`) issues JWTs and publishes public keys at `/.well-known/jwks.json`
2. Your microservice (running `authfort-service`) fetches the public keys from JWKS
3. When a request comes in, it verifies the JWT signature using the cached public key
4. No database or network call needed for verification (keys are cached)

## Verification Modes

| Mode | How | Latency | Real-time Revocation |
|------|-----|---------|---------------------|
| **JWKS only** | Verify signature locally | None (cached keys) | No — tokens valid until expiry |
| **JWKS + Introspection** | Verify signature, then check auth server | 1 network call | Yes — checks ban, session, version |

JWKS-only is the default. Add introspection when you need real-time revocation checks (e.g., for sensitive operations).
